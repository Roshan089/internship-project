# 3D Arm Rotation - Next.js & Three.js

## Overview
This project is a **Next.js** web page that uses **Three.js** and **@react-three/fiber** to render a simple 3D **arm model** with rotation handles at the **shoulder** and **elbow** joints. Users can **click and drag** the handles to adjust the arm's pose, with real-time transformations.

## Features
✅ Interactive 3D arm with shoulder and elbow joints  
✅ Drag-to-rotate functionality for adjusting pose  
✅ Smooth real-time transformations  
✅ Clean, minimal UI with Tailwind CSS  

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js** - Frontend framework  
- **Three.js** - 3D rendering and interaction  
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling  


## Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arm-rotation.git
cd arm-rotation
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Development Server
```sh
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.


## Live Demo

## How It Works
### 🦾 3D Arm Model
- **Upper Arm:** Gray cylinder (extends from the shoulder).
- **Lower Arm:** Light gray cylinder (attached to the upper arm).
- **Handles:** Blue spheres at **shoulder** and **elbow**.

### 🖱️ Interaction Logic
1. **Click & Drag a handle** (shoulder or elbow).
2. **Mouse movement** updates rotation in real time.
3. **Shoulder Handle** rotates the upper arm around the **Y-axis**.
4. **Elbow Handle** rotates the lower arm around its **local Y-axis**.

## Submission Instructions
1. **Push code to a private GitHub repository**.
2. **Invite yash.aocorp@gmail.com** as a collaborator.
3. **Ensure README.md** is included.

## Future Improvements
🚀 Add inverse kinematics for more natural movement  
🎨 Improve UI/UX for better usability  
📱 Make it responsive for mobile interaction
